Run figure2 to get graphics from Fig2 and SuppFig2. Result tables contain p-values for each interval of the corresponding group (Bonferroni-corrected significant p-value is 0.0125).

Run figureSupp to get instantaneous firing rate graphics from SuppFig3 and SuppFig4.

Datasets (e.g. A-10) contain spike times (spikes) as well as trigger information 
(number of trials per run and memory status: trials; 
spike times with corresponding run information: spikeTrigger; 
corresponding source info: info1 ,info2)
